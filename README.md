AstraFlow is an agentic AI-driven platform that transforms natural language requests into complex, automated multi-step workflows‚Äîpowered by LLMs, cloud orchestration, and auto-monitoring. Designed for analysts, business teams, and recruiters to automate repetitive tasks, AstraFlow connects web, API, data, and reporting tools into seamless, production-ready processes.

üö© Problem Statement:
In fast-paced professional environments, teams waste hours each week on data collection, document generation, summarizing content, emailing updates, and other repetitive but ‚Äúconnected‚Äù digital workflows. Most no-code tools and scripts only automate one tiny step, requiring constant manual intervention and context-switching.

AstraFlow bridges this gap with agentic AI and orchestration‚Äîletting users submit a business goal (‚ÄúSummarize today‚Äôs top AI news, create a PDF, email my team‚Äù) and automating every step: planning, execution, monitoring, and delivery.


üß† Solution Highlights:
Natural Language Input
Describe your workflow in plain English.

LLM-Powered Task Planning and Execution
Multi-agent AI parses input, decomposes tasks, and triggers modules:

Web scraping/data acquisition

Summarization/generation

Reporting (PDF/CSV creation, dashboard update)

Action delivery (email, Slack, cloud storage)

Interactive UI & Secure API
Use via web dashboard or integrate with your own apps/scripts.

Monitoring & Feedback
Every workflow is tracked, logged, and quality-checked‚Äîhelping you trust and improve automation.

Cloud-Ready & Easy to Extend
Deploy on AWS/GCP/heroku, add new data sources or actions with modular code.
